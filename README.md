## WORK EXPERIENCE
# Teaching Assistant CSP 571
Illinois Institute of Technology , Chicago, IL 05 2024-06 2024
 Conducted office hours to provide assistance to students, addressing their specific queries about CS 571, a 
course focused on Data Preparation and Analysis, thereby enhancing their understanding and 
performance in the subject.
 Coordinated and facilitated live sessions, systematically managing student inquiries via a tracking sheet to 
ensure comprehensive resolution of doubts by both myself and the professor, promoting a thorough 
understanding of course material.
 Evaluated assignments rigorously, and provided constructive feedback to students, offering detailed 
explanations for incorrect responses to foster learning and ensure satisfaction with the educational support 
provided.


### MACHINE LEARNING INTERN 
Ineurone Intelligence Pvt Ltd, Bangalore, IN 11 2021-02 2022
 Local restaurants were suffering from less profits due to less customer visit.
 Scraped the Zomato website using Selenium and BeautifulSoup tools.
 Gathered statistical relationships of every feature with the target variable using statistical tests like the Ttest and ANOVA test, and utilized Tableau for visualization.
 Engineered categorical variables and created new columns with a high relationship to the target variable.
 Employed various models and compared their performance using methods like the F-test and F1 score, 
ultimately achieving an 87% accuracy.
 Local restaurants utilized the insights to enhance customer satisfaction, resulting in higher ratings and 
increased patronage.

## PROJECT EXPERIENCE
### Enfit Energy Prediction model 02 2024-03 2024
 
 Developed an energy prediction model for prosumers aimed at reducing energy imbalance costs.
 Utilized Pyspark to handle six CSV files, each containing over 2 million rows, and employed my SQL 
expertise to merge them efficiently.
 Conducted feature engineering on the variables to enhance their correlation with the target variable.
 Trained the XGBoost model to attain high accuracy in predictions.
 Employed R-square and other evaluation metrics to assess the performance of the model.

### Bias Evaluation of Different model 01 2023- 04 2023
 Research to check the key aspects of LLM model to produce bias results. 
 Coordinated with a team of four students to investigate biases between traditional models (SVM and 
Logistic Regression) and Large Language Models (BERT and RoBERTa).
 Analyzed a provided dataset to assess the presence of biases in the models' predictions.
 Meticulously processed the dataset, implementing tokenization and formatting to ensure optimal input 
for the models.
 Integrated the prepared data into the models and processed diverse test cases to comprehensively evaluate 
their performance.
